## 🕯️ What is CodedSoul?

CodedSoul is a neurodivergent-first, glitchpunk-coded dev ecosystem for ritual software and emotional engines.

We make weird tools for weird people:
- 💾 Personal AI daemons (NyxEngine)
- 🎛️ ADHD-friendly creative workflows
- 🕷️ Mental health-coded systems built for survival, not scale
- 🚫 No Web3. No hype. No VC blood money.

We’re not making software *for* the system.  
We’re making software *because* of what it did to us.
